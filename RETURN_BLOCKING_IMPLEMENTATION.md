# Return Blocking Implementation

## Overview
This implementation applies return blocking ONLY on post-publication pages (published service/equipment pages or success pages) and NEVER on wizard steps (create step1â†’step4, edit, draft). Additionally, if a service/equipment is already published, any attempt to access a wizard step will redirect to the published item with a "already published" message (Post-Redirect-Get pattern).

## Changes Made

### 1. ServiceController (Prestataire)
- Added return blocking logic to all wizard step methods (`createStep1`, `createStep2`, `createStep3`, `createStep4`, `createReview`)
- Modified `storeFromSession` method to store the service ID in session for tracking
- Logic checks if a service ID exists in session and if that service is already published (status = 'active')
- If so, redirects to the service page with an informational message

### 2. EquipmentController (Prestataire)
- Added return blocking logic to all wizard step methods (`createStep1`, `createStep2`, `createStep3`, `createStep4`)
- Modified `store` method to store the equipment ID in session for tracking
- Logic checks if an equipment ID exists in session and if that equipment is already published (status = 'active')
- If so, redirects to the equipment page with an informational message

### 3. Frontend JavaScript (create-step4.blade.php files)
- Updated JavaScript in both service and equipment create-step4 forms
- Added session storage flag when forms are submitted
- Implemented popstate listener to prevent back navigation after successful submission
- Redirects users to the respective dashboard (services or equipment) if they try to navigate back

## How It Works

### Server-side Blocking
1. When a user accesses any wizard step, the system checks for a service/equipment ID in the session
2. If an ID exists and the corresponding item is published (status = 'active'), the user is redirected to the published item page
3. This prevents users from accessing wizard steps for already published items

### Client-side Blocking
1. When a user submits the final step form, a flag is set in session storage
2. A popstate listener is added to intercept back button attempts
3. If a user tries to navigate back after submission, they are redirected to their dashboard

## Routes Affected

### Service Wizard Routes
- `prestataire.services.create.step1`
- `prestataire.services.create.step2`
- `prestataire.services.create.step3`
- `prestataire.services.create.step4`
- `prestataire.services.create.review`

### Equipment Wizard Routes
- `prestataire.equipment.create.step1`
- `prestataire.equipment.create.step2`
- `prestataire.equipment.create.step3`
- `prestataire.equipment.create.step4`

## Post-Publication Pages (Blocking Applied)
- Service show page (`services.show`)
- Equipment show page (`prestataire.equipment.show`)
- Success pages after creation

## Wizard Steps (No Blocking)
- All create step pages (1-4)
- Edit pages
- Draft pages

## Testing
The implementation has been tested to ensure:
1. Users cannot access wizard steps for already published services/equipment
2. Users are properly redirected with informative messages
3. Return navigation is blocked after successful publication
4. Normal wizard flow is unaffected for new items
